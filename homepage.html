		<h1> He has a moustache</h1>
		<p class ="a">Bradley began his journey with facial hair at the age of 18. He was fresh into his college journey, and head
		was eager to participate in his first no shave November. It was attrocious and something that he quickly should have realized 
		he should not do again. But he persisted.  After many revisions, he now sports a pretty handsome moustache.</p>
		
		<h1>He brews his own beer</h1>
		<p class ="a">Bradley didn't always brew beer. A few years ago he had a roommate accidentaly let an A/C unit fall out of the 
		window. It broke and he gave Bradley a homebrew starter kit to make up for it. Even though Bradley had no connection to the
		A/C unit he accepted it nonetheless. His first brew wasn't terrible, and he continues to make not terrible beer to this day.</p>
		<h1>He's a dungeon master</h1>
		<p class ="a">There once was a introductory Dungeons and Dragons night at a local Grand Rapids brewery. Bradley and his friends
		wanted to go, but it was full. There was little hope for a chance to adventure. So Bradley and friends went to the local game store
		and picked up an introductory adventure. Many combats, treasure, and levels later the group still meets every Thursday with few
		exceptions. He wonders though, why has nobody died? Is there no risk to these adventures?</p>
