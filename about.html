		<h1>How did he even do it?</h1>
			<p class ="a"> Bradley's professional career started soon after he finished college. He was done with working for a 
			catering company. He got a big boyish job working for Grand Valley in their College of Nursing. It didn't last too 
			long but he was able to learn a few things.</p>
			<p class ="a">After his stint working for GVSU he got a "temp" job working for BSI Healthcare. I say temp only because
			he was there for two and a half years. Much longer than he expected. While he was working a job he was unhappy with he
			had a couple of friends go through this program called Grand Circus. It piqued his interest. After hearing about all
			of the cool things that people do and learn there he had to give it a go. In July he said, "Toodaloo," to his old 
			workplace. He hasn't looked back since.
